swt = Text detection based on Stroke Width Transform

=====

This project extracts text from image for recognition by 3rd-party OCR.

- compiler with C++11 support
    - clang on OS/X
    - gcc >= 4.7

Design
------------

Basically, the library supports the extraction of text from natural scenes,
including text at an angle.

The stroke width transform uses an edge image of the text to compute a stroke-width
value for every pixel on or inside a contour.  Said values should be smoothly varying
and nearly constant within a text component.  We find and label such components by a
flood-filling algorithm. Components that are too small or large are rejected.   

Then, the components are filtered and merged to find likely characters and words.
We find the minimal bounding box around each candidate word, which is not necessarily
horizontal; given the orientation angle of the box, we rotate the candidate word to
make it horizontal.

Each horizontal candidate word is sent to Tesseract for recognition.

Most of the processing is done by OpenCV functions on OpenCV images and other
objects.  However, this core processing is encapsulated` into Gracenote-format objects
operating on Gracenote-format images.
